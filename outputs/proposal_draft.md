# **Research Proposal**


## Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in healthcare but suffer from "hallucinations" and a lack of grounding in established medical knowledge and causal reasoning, posing risks to patient safety. This research addresses this critical gap by proposing "GroundedMed-LLM," a novel framework designed to enhance LLM safety and reliability for clinical support. Our approach involves deeply integrating LLMs with curated medical Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and explicit causal reasoning modules. The methodology includes developing KG-to-LLM integration mechanisms for dynamic retrieval and knowledge injection, and incorporating causal models to ensure outputs are clinically coherent and adhere to established cause-and-effect relationships. GroundedMed-LLM will be prototyped and rigorously evaluated on clinical support tasks, such as differential diagnosis and query answering, using metrics for factual accuracy, clinical validity, KG grounding, causal consistency, and reduction in hallucinations. We expect this framework to significantly improve LLM trustworthiness, increase clinician adoption, support better clinical decision-making, and contribute to the development of responsible AI in healthcare.

**1. Background & Literature Review**

**1.1. Generative AI in Healthcare: An Overview**

Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) encompasses machine learning models designed to learn underlying data distributions and generate new, synthetic data instances that mirror the original data (Goodfellow et al., 2014). Unlike discriminative AI, which classifies or predicts based on input features, generative AI focuses on the data generation process itself. This capability holds immense transformative potential for healthcare, offering avenues to address challenges in diagnostics, therapeutics, medical research, and operational efficiency (Lit Review Sec 1.1, 1.2). By synthesizing realistic medical data, accelerating drug discovery, and personalizing treatments, generative AI promises to enhance patient outcomes and optimize healthcare delivery (Frid-Adar et al., 2018; Putin et al., 2018).

**1.2. Large Language Models (LLMs) in Clinical Applications**

Among generative AI techniques, Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly those based on the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text. Models such as GPT variants (Brown et al., 2020) are increasingly being explored for diverse clinical applications. These include automating clinical note generation from doctor-patient dialogues, summarizing extensive patient records from Electronic Health Records (EHRs), developing medical chatbots for patient engagement and information dissemination, and generating personalized educational materials for patients (Liang et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2023; Lit Review Sec 2.1.3, 3.3.4, 3.4.1).

**1.3. Critical Limitations of Current LLMs in Healthcare**

Despite their potential, current LLMs exhibit significant limitations when applied to the healthcare domain. A primary concern is the "hallucination" phenomenon, where models generate plausible-sounding but factually incorrect or clinically invalid information (Singhal et al., 2023; Lit Review Sec 6.1). This unreliability stems from several core issues:
*   **Lack of robust grounding in established medical knowledge:** LLMs are typically trained on vast, general text corpora and may not have inherent access to or prioritize verified medical facts.
*   **Poor understanding of medical causality:** Clinical reasoning heavily relies on understanding cause-and-effect relationships (e.g., disease progression, drug interactions), a capability often absent in standard LLMs.
*   **Challenges in explainability and interpretability:** The "black box" nature of many LLMs makes it difficult to understand how they arrive at specific outputs, hindering clinician trust and the ability to verify information (Samek et al., 2017; Lit Review Sec 4.3).

These limitations pose substantial risks if LLMs are used in clinical decision support without appropriate safeguards, potentially leading to diagnostic errors, unsafe treatment suggestions, or misleading patient information.

**1.4. Existing Approaches to Enhance LLM Reliability**

Several strategies have been explored to improve LLM performance in specialized domains. Fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs on domain-specific corpora (e.g., medical literature, clinical notes) can adapt them to medical language and concepts. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) (Lewis et al., 2020) is another prominent approach, where LLMs retrieve relevant information from an external knowledge base before generating a response. While RAG can improve factual accuracy, standard RAG systems often struggle with complex reasoning, deep semantic understanding of the retrieved context, and ensuring adherence to intricate clinical logic or causal constraints, especially when multiple pieces of conflicting or nuanced information are present.

**1.5. Medical Knowledge Graphs (KGs) as a Foundation for Grounding**

Medical Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a structured and explicit representation of medical knowledge, comprising entities (e.g., diseases, drugs, symptoms, anatomical structures) and their relationships (e.g., 'treats', 'causes', 'is_a_symptom_of'). Examples of comprehensive medical KGs include the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), SNOMED CT, and DrugBank. By encoding verified medical facts and terminologies in a machine-readable format, KGs can provide a robust foundation for grounding LLM outputs, ensuring they are consistent with established medical understanding and reducing the likelihood of factual inaccuracies.

**1.6. Causal Reasoning in Medicine and AI**

Causal understanding is fundamental to clinical decision-making, enabling clinicians to diagnose diseases, predict prognoses, and select appropriate treatments. Integrating causal reasoning into AI systems aims to imbue them with the ability to understand *why* certain events occur or *how* interventions lead to specific outcomes. In the context of LLMs, this involves moving beyond statistical correlations in data to incorporate principles of cause and effect. While comprehensive causal inference (e.g., involving Pearl's do-calculus) can be complex, even simplified causal models representing established medical relationships (e.g., via causal graphs or rules) can significantly enhance the plausibility and safety of LLM-generated content. However, effectively integrating such causal reasoning mechanisms with the inherently data-driven, pattern-matching nature of LLMs remains a significant challenge.

**1.7. Related Work in Knowledge-Grounded and Causal LLMs**

There is a growing body of research focused on integrating KGs with LLMs to improve their factual accuracy and domain specificity (Zakka et al., 2024). These efforts range from using KGs to enhance input representations to guiding the generation process or validating outputs. Similarly, research is emerging on incorporating causal reasoning into NLP and generative models, aiming to make their outputs more robust and explainable. However, most existing approaches either focus on general domain applications or employ relatively shallow integration techniques. There remains a critical need for frameworks that deeply synergize KGs and causal reasoning specifically for the complex and safety-critical demands of healthcare, ensuring that LLM outputs are not only factually correct but also clinically coherent and safe. The proposed research aims to address this gap by developing a framework for more profound integration.

**2. Problem Statement & Research Gap**

**2.1. Problem Statement**

Despite their advanced capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, current Large Language Models (LLMs) are not sufficiently reliable for many critical clinical support tasks. Their propensity to "hallucinate"—generating information that is factually incorrect, not grounded in evidence, or clinically unsafe—poses significant risks to patient safety and undermines clinician trust. This unreliability stems from their training on vast but often unstructured text data, without inherent mechanisms to access, verify, and reason with established medical knowledge or understand causal relationships critical to clinical contexts.

**2.2. Research Gap**

There is a pressing need for robust and scalable frameworks that deeply integrate explicit, structured medical domain knowledge (from Knowledge Graphs) and causal reasoning principles directly into the generative process of LLMs. While some methods like basic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) exist, they often fall short in ensuring deep semantic grounding and applying complex clinical logic or causal constraints. The specific research gap lies in developing methodologies that enable LLMs not just to retrieve relevant facts, but to actively reason with them and adhere to causal principles, thereby producing outputs that are demonstrably safer, more accurate, and clinically valid for healthcare applications. This research aims to bridge this gap by developing and evaluating such an integrated framework.

**3. Proposed Gen AI Approach (Methodology)**

**3.1. Overall Research Aim**

To develop and evaluate a novel framework, "GroundedMed-LLM," that integrates medical Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and causal reasoning mechanisms with Large Language Models to significantly enhance their factual accuracy, clinical safety, and interpretability for clinical support tasks.

**3.2. Objective 1: Development of a KG-Integrated LLM Architecture**

*   **3.2.1. Medical Knowledge Graph Curation/Selection:**
    *   We will identify and adapt a comprehensive medical KG suitable for clinical support. This may involve utilizing a subset of a large-scale existing KG like UMLS, potentially enriched with specific domain knowledge (e.g., from clinical guidelines or specialized databases like DrugBank for drug-related information). Alternatively, a purpose-built KG focusing on selected clinical areas relevant to the evaluation use cases (e.g., common diseases, symptoms, treatments) may be developed.
    *   A clear schema defining entities (e.g., `Disease`, `Symptom`, `Drug`, `Test`) and relations (e.g., `has_symptom`, `treats`, `contraindicated_for`, `causes_side_effect`) will be established.
    *   An efficient API for querying the KG will be developed or leveraged to allow rapid retrieval of relevant subgraphs or facts.

*   **3.2.2. KG-to-LLM Integration Mechanisms:**
    *   **Dynamic Retrieval Module:** This module will, given an input query (e.g., patient symptoms, clinician question) and the current generation context from the LLM, identify and retrieve the most relevant entities and relations from the KG. Techniques such as entity linking to map query terms to KG concepts and graph traversal algorithms will be explored.
    *   **Knowledge Injection Techniques:** We will investigate methods to effectively inject the retrieved KG information into the LLM. This could include:
        *   Augmenting the input prompt with structured representations of KG facts (e.g., linearized triples or natural language descriptions derived from KG subgraphs).
        *   Modifying the LLM's attention mechanism to explicitly attend to relevant KG entities/relations during generation.
        *   Employing adapter layers or fine-tuning approaches that train the LLM to utilize KG context.
    *   **Iterative Refinement Loop:** An iterative process will be explored where the LLM generates an initial response, which is then cross-referenced and validated against the KG. Discrepancies or missing information identified through KG validation can then trigger a refinement step, prompting the LLM to revise its output for improved accuracy and completeness based on KG evidence.

**3.3. Objective 2: Incorporation of Causal Reasoning Modules**

*   **3.3.1. Causal Model Representation:**
    *   We will define a lightweight yet effective representation for pertinent medical causal relationships. This will likely involve extracting causal assertions from medical literature, clinical guidelines, or expert knowledge, focusing on common clinical scenarios.
    *   Representations may include:
        *   Causal rules (e.g., `IF Condition_A AND Patient_Factor_B THEN Risk_Of_Outcome_C_increases`).
        *   Simplified causal graphs depicting relationships like symptom → disease, drug → therapeutic_effect, drug → side_effect, risk_factor → condition.
    *   The scope will initially be focused on clearly established and less ambiguous causal links relevant to the chosen use cases.

*   **3.3.2. Causal Constraint and Inference Mechanisms:**
    *   **Causal Consistency Checker:** A module will be developed to verify LLM-generated statements against the defined causal rules or graph. For example, it would flag if an LLM suggests a drug for a condition where the KG or causal model indicates a contraindication, or if it posits a causal link not supported by the model.
    *   **Simple Causal Inference Engine:** This component will enable the LLM to perform basic causal inferences based on the input query, retrieved KG information, and the causal model. For instance, if a patient presents with symptom X, and the causal model states that disease Y commonly causes symptom X, the system can prioritize disease Y in a differential diagnosis. Similarly, if a patient has condition A and is prescribed drug B, the system can infer potential interactions or side effects based on known causal links.
    *   **Causally-Guided Generation:** We will explore methods to use the causal graph structures to guide the LLM's generation pathways, encouraging it to explore clinically plausible sequences of reasoning or explanations that align with established causal links.

**3.4. Objective 3: Prototyping and Evaluation of GroundedMed-LLM**

*   **3.4.1. Prototype Development:**
    *   A prototype of the GroundedMed-LLM framework will be implemented.
    *   Focus will be on 1-2 specific clinical support use cases for initial development and evaluation, such as:
        *   Generating preliminary differential diagnoses based on presented symptoms, patient history, and relevant findings.
        *   Answering clinician queries regarding drug interactions, side effects, or adherence to treatment guidelines for specific patient profiles.
    *   An existing pre-trained LLM (e.g., a Llama variant or a GPT-class model accessible via API, depending on resource availability and ethical approvals) will serve as the base model.

*   **3.4.2. Dataset Preparation:**
    *   For evaluation, we will utilize existing de-identified clinical datasets where possible, such as notes from MIMIC-IV (Johnson et al., 2023) for information extraction and summarization tasks, or publicly available medical case reports.
    *   For tasks like differential diagnosis or query answering, synthetic or semi-synthetic datasets may be developed. These will consist of input queries (e.g., symptom sets, patient scenarios) paired with gold-standard answers or evaluations, potentially annotated by medical experts. These annotations will serve as the ground truth for evaluating factual accuracy and clinical validity.

*   **3.4.3. Evaluation Metrics:**
    The performance of GroundedMed-LLM will be assessed using a comprehensive set of metrics:
    *   **Factual Accuracy:**
        *   Percentage of generated statements that are factually correct as per medical literature or expert review.
        *   Entity-level precision and recall against the KG for tasks involving specific medical entities.
    *   **Clinical Validity/Safety:**
        *   Expert clinician review using Likert scales (e.g., 1-5) to rate the safety, appropriateness, completeness, and clinical utility of generated outputs.
        *   Systematic identification and quantification of harmful hallucinations (e.g., clinically dangerous suggestions, factually incorrect statements with potential for harm).
    *   **KG Grounding Score:** A metric to measure the proportion of factual claims in the generated output that can be directly traced back to evidence in the integrated KG.
    *   **Causal Consistency Score:** A measure of the LLM's adherence to the defined causal rules and models. This could involve expert scoring or automated checks against the causal model.
    *   **Reduction in Hallucinations:** Comparative analysis of hallucination rates (using pre-defined criteria for identifying hallucinations) between GroundedMed-LLM and baseline models.
    *   **Interpretability/Explainability:** Qualitative assessment by clinicians of the system's ability to provide justifications for its outputs by citing KG facts or causal rules used in the generation process.

*   **3.4.4. Experimental Setup:**
    *   The GroundedMed-LLM framework will be rigorously compared against several baselines:
        *   A standard pre-trained LLM (e.g., the base model used in GroundedMed-LLM without the proposed integrations).
        *   The same base LLM fine-tuned on relevant medical domain data (if a suitable fine-tuned version is available or feasible to create).
        *   The same base LLM integrated with a standard RAG approach (using the same KG but without the proposed deep integration or causal reasoning).
    *   Ablation studies will be conducted to assess the individual contributions of the KG integration module and the causal reasoning module to the overall performance improvements. This will involve evaluating versions of GroundedMed-LLM with either the KG component or the causal reasoning component disabled.

**4. Expected Impact in Healthcare**

The successful development and validation of the GroundedMed-LLM framework are anticipated to have several significant positive impacts on healthcare:

*   **4.1. Enhanced Safety and Reliability of LLMs:** By grounding LLM outputs in verified medical KGs and ensuring consistency with causal principles, the framework will significantly reduce the risk of LLMs providing incorrect, misleading, or harmful information, making them safer for deployment in clinical support roles.
*   **4.2. Increased Clinician Trust and Adoption:** More accurate, verifiable, and interpretable outputs will foster greater clinician confidence in using LLM-based tools. The ability to trace information back to KG facts or understand the causal logic applied will be crucial for building this trust.
*   **4.3. Improved Clinical Decision-Making Support:** The framework will equip clinicians with a more dependable AI assistant for tasks such as rapid information synthesis from complex patient data, exploration of differential diagnoses, and checking adherence to treatment guidelines. This can lead to more informed decisions and potentially better patient outcomes.
*   **4.4. Reduction in Medical Errors:** By mitigating the potential for AI-induced errors stemming from hallucinations or lack of medical grounding, the proposed system can contribute to a reduction in medical errors associated with information retrieval or interpretation.
*   **4.5. Foundation for Advanced AI Applications in Healthcare:** This research will provide a robust methodology and a proven architectural blueprint for developing more trustworthy generative AI systems. This can pave the way for their application in increasingly critical and complex healthcare scenarios.
*   **4.6. Contribution to Responsible AI Development:** The project will offer valuable insights, techniques, and best practices for building AI systems that are not only powerful but also aligned with ethical principles and stringent safety requirements, particularly in sensitive domains like healthcare. This contributes to the broader goal of responsible AI innovation.

**5. Limitations or Ethical Considerations**

**5.1. Limitations of the Proposed Research**

*   **KG Comprehensiveness and Accuracy:** The performance of GroundedMed-LLM will be inherently dependent on the quality, coverage, and currency of the medical KG used. KGs can be incomplete, contain outdated information, or reflect biases present in their source data. Maintaining and updating the KG will be an ongoing challenge.
*   **Complexity of Medical Causality:** Medicine involves intricate and often multifactorial causal relationships. This research will likely focus on simplified causal models for specific, well-defined contexts. Capturing the full spectrum and nuances of medical causality is beyond the scope of this initial work and remains a long-term challenge for AI.
*   **Scalability:** Integrating complex KGs and sophisticated reasoning mechanisms with large-scale LLMs can be computationally intensive, potentially posing challenges for real-time performance and resource requirements.
*   **Generalizability:** The framework's effectiveness will be rigorously evaluated on specific clinical support tasks and datasets. Its generalizability to other clinical specialties, different types of LLMs, or diverse patient populations not explicitly covered in the evaluation will require further investigation.
*   **Bias in Knowledge Sources:** Both medical KGs (derived from literature or databases) and causal models (derived from existing knowledge or data) may inherit biases present in their source materials (e.g., demographic, socioeconomic biases related to disease prevalence or treatment efficacy).

**5.2. Ethical Considerations**

The proposed research will proactively address several critical ethical considerations, referencing key areas identified in the literature (Lit Review Sec 4 & 5):

*   **Bias and Fairness (Lit Review Sec 4.1):**
    *   *Consideration:* The KGs and causal rules used could reflect existing biases in medical data or literature.
    *   *Mitigation Strategy:* We will conduct audits of the selected/developed KG and causal models for potential biases (e.g., related to demographics, socioeconomic factors). Where feasible, strategies to mitigate identified biases in the integrated system, or at least flag them, will be explored. Evaluation will include assessing fairness across subgroups if data permits.
*   **Accountability and Responsibility (Lit Review Sec 4.2):**
    *   *Consideration:* Determining accountability if the AI tool contributes to an adverse outcome.
    *   *Mitigation Strategy:* GroundedMed-LLM is designed as a clinical *support* tool, not a replacement for human clinicians. The framework aims to improve reliability, but ultimate accountability for clinical decisions will remain with the healthcare professional. Clear documentation will emphasize the system's role as an assistant, its limitations, and the necessity of human oversight.
*   **Explainability and Interpretability (Lit Review Sec 4.3):**
    *   *Consideration:* The "black box" nature of LLMs.
    *   *Mitigation Strategy:* A core goal of this research is to enhance interpretability. By linking LLM outputs to specific facts in the KG and applied causal rules, we aim to provide clearer justifications for generated information. The level of achievable explainability will be a key evaluation metric, acknowledging that full transparency of the LLM's internal workings may still be limited.
*   **Data Privacy and Security (Lit Review Sec 5.1, 5.2):**
    *   *Consideration:* Use of sensitive patient data for development or evaluation.
    *   *Mitigation Strategy:* If patient data (e.g., from MIMIC-IV) is used, it will be strictly de-identified and handled in accordance with all relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR) and institutional review board (IRB) approvals. Secure data handling practices, access controls, and potentially privacy-preserving techniques like federated learning (Rieke et al., 2020) for future extensions will be considered. Synthetic data generation will also be explored to minimize direct use of real patient data where appropriate.
*   **Potential for Misuse (Lit Review Sec 4.4):**
    *   *Consideration:* Even an improved LLM could be misused if its outputs are taken out of context or its limitations are not understood.
    *   *Mitigation Strategy:* Clear communication regarding the system's intended use, capabilities, and inherent limitations will be crucial. Outputs will be designed to encourage critical assessment by clinicians.
*   **Over-Reliance and Deskilling (Lit Review Sec 4.5):**
    *   *Consideration:* Clinicians becoming overly dependent on AI or losing certain skills.
    *   *Mitigation Strategy:* The system will be designed as an assistive tool to augment, not replace, clinical judgment and expertise. The emphasis will be on human-AI collaboration, aiming to free up clinicians from tedious tasks to focus on complex decision-making and patient interaction.
*   **Informed Consent (Lit Review Sec 4.6):**
    *   *Consideration:* Obtaining consent for data use or clinician participation in evaluation.
    *   *Mitigation Strategy:* For any stages of the research involving clinician participation for evaluation (e.g., expert review of outputs) or the use of patient data beyond fully de-identified public datasets, appropriate informed consent procedures will be followed, and IRB approval will be secured.
